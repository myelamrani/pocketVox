# it provides and easy way to create a raw file to use with the cmuclmtk kit
# to create your own langage model.
# In order to create a raw file avalaible for cmuclmtk you should give
# a folder containing dictionnary files
# or a list of such a folder
# a dictionnary is simply a list of key=value like this
# open my documents=xdg-open ~/Documents
# This script will browse all your dictionnaries, get all formated line to
# create a valid raw that you can paste to a raw file
# check if there is files
